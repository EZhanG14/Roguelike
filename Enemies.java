/* ideas for enemies,
  - pokemon based system
  - only 2 options: fight or run
  - run always work
   - enemies will always have 4 health
   - player has 5 health
   - player attack will do 1 or 3 damage depending if they have a sword (see inventory.java)
   - If player dies (will require player to face 2 enemies at least), then show game over screen where terminal tells user that they are dead
   and thank them for playing.
   - use any symbols for enemies that are not being used already
    - find a way to import the enemies into the map.
